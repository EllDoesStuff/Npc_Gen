# Overview 

This is a basic NPC generator that can be incredibly useful in your next text adventure game. Many popular games have NPC's, and at this point it's become a staple of games entirely. This NPC generator generates random NPC's with Damage, Defense, Health, and a special number! All of these options allow for many things to be created, like fights, or companions, or anything, really! 

## 🌟 How it works!

If you're going to use this program, you're going to at least need an overview of the code itself, just in case you'd like to add or subtract something.

Here are the main takeaways of this program:

- Top lines contain a list for first and last names, which can be changed to fit the setting of your game.
- While loop contains NPC Generation code!
- You'll see the options for Yes and No answers, adjust those to other languages as needed.
- A formatted string contains the four elements mentioned previously, adjust numbers as needed.
- Bottom contains messages displayed when program is finished running, adjust to other languages as needed.

### Thank you!
I'd like to thank you for using this program for your game, and for trusting 4th Dimensional Studios for your Random Code Needs™.
